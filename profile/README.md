EucaStack is an open source AWS-compatible hybrid cloud powered by Eucalyptus. EucaStack extends the open source Eucalyptus and Midonet projects to provide an on-premise cloud you can run in your datacenter. Having an on-premise private cloud with AWS-compatible APIs creates a hybrid cloud experience for organizations running workloads in public AWS regions.
